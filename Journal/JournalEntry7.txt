WEB601 Journal Entry 7
The class today was focussed on building our knowledge of some JavaScript (JS), in particular we started to examine using functions, calling functions and looking at the precedence that JS applies to the order that it runs functions or reads any code for that matter.  Ali has referred us to more tutorials as well as providing a lot of really useful learning tools on the classes Git Book page, there goes my weekend ðŸ˜Š  I have just finished the tutorials on CSS and just added a pic of the completed courses to my GitHub.  
Ali also stressed that we should have the initial concept and some wire frames created for the Milestone One for the big project.  I must admit that Im a little bit behind on this but I do have a concept client (restaurant/bar/venue) needing a 5-6 page website (home, menu, events, about, blog and contact pages) I havenâ€™t decided on the color scheme and the site theme just yet and I will do a bit of research before I do.  
The client would need the website to display info about the buisness such as menus, posts from the owner and related articles, pictures, upcoming events, etc.  I may even add a members section depending on time and difficulty.  My plan for the weekend is to get more of the concept down (research, colours, theme, font, rough wireframes, target market, etc) and to make some headway with the JS tutorial on Code Academy.
