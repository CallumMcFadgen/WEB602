WEB601 Journal Entry 5
In the last class we joined a slack group that Ali had set up the WEB602 class, it looks really interesting and its very cool to be using things like Git and Slack because of the practical real world applications for those skills. 
In class we started to develop our concepts into a web page via a shared Git repository.  It didn’t go particularly well as it took a while for us all to start getting our heads around how pushing and pulling would work with 5 people working together on a single project (not something any of us have done before in the past).  This was a good lesson, as it really highlighted the need for good clear communication and a structured workflow and delegation of tasks. The system that Ali had mentioned in class last week, which involved a git controller monitoring the Git repository and managing the workflow on that end as well as issuing task cards to keep a clean workflow, sounded like a great idea by the end of the class.
For homework Ali asked us to continue to work on the intro to HTML and CSS CodeAcademy lessons and to begin looking at the requirements of milestone one of the course project.  As an additional task we can also begin building a web page about ourselves for practice and to potentially become a resume page.
I have already finished the HTML tutorial, which I enjoyed, and I am 55% through the CSS tutorial which has also been really interesting.  I have started a webpage and added it to my Git so I can practice Git commands while I work on it in my spare time, at the moment it is a very basic layup with a few initial CSS styles, I’m using bootstrap as Im already familiar with their grid system for controlling HTML element responsiveness.
