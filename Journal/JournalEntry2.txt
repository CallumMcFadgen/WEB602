WEB601 Journal Entry 2
I decided to work through the git exercises that we were doing through the learn with git webpage and try to apply them to my git repo that I’m working on.
Unfortunately, I made lots of mistakes and I've actually ended up redoing my WEB602 repo altogether because it was such a mess and I couldn’t get
everything to synch.
Good practice I suppose, as I would rather make the mistakes now than later on when I have an actual project on the go, but I can already see
poor Ali being swamped with "help me" requests for the next few weeks lol.
The worst thing is that I’m not quite sure where I was going wrong so I will just have to be careful and try to use best practice.
