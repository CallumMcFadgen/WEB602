WEB601 Journal Entry 3
I am stating to get a bit of a handle on git, I’m starting a doc to record the command lines that I find the most useful.
I still feel a bit worried as I did have a repeat of the problems I initially encountered (the master is ahead of the repo master and I cant get the two to synch up) so I might need to chat to Ali at some point and see where I’m going wrong.
